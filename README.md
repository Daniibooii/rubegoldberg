# Rube Goldberg Machine

# Project Description
This project represents a group effort to create a Rube Goldberg Machine-creating game, with multiple levels.<br>
The project was conceived and organized by Chandler Dibble.<br>
The game was developed by a four-person team over one week.<br>
The total time spent developing our project, including time spent learning new tools, is estimated at 120+ hours.<br>

We primarily utilized Javascript with Matter.js.<br>
HTML and CSS were deliberately de-emphasized to allow us to generate our images, shapes, etc. with Javascript.<br>
This is reflected in contributors' roles all including "back-end" work.<br>
Spotify and GIPHY APIs were utilized.<br>
Significant time was devoted to learning Matter.js and implementing ES6, with which we were unfamiliar but eager to practice.<br>

Internally, we needed to generate a basic world for our games.<br>
Objects were created and assigned values to allow their proper interaction.<br>
Functions were written to generate our objects, cause them to interact, and influence the manner in which they interacted.<br>

Each project member spent time learning how to implement Matter.js and ES6.<br>
All members contributed to the Javscript elements, as well as thinking up and creating their own mini-game.<br>

## How to Use
The user will need to clone a copy of our repo.<br>
Then, he or she should open the index.html file in a browser of their choice.<br>
The user will then play through a series of levels, or mini-games.<br>
Each level contains its own challenge, which won't be revealed here.<br>

The user will interact with a choice of objects and place or utilize them to attempt to solve challenges.<br>

## Notes
One of the challenges we faced was in dealing with the many different syntax options available to us as a result of bringing in ES6 when/where able. The difficulty of developing a fully-functional Rube Goldberg Machine took some time to become apparent. Our vision was significantly more difficult/time-consuming to implement than it first appeared. Still, we are delighted with how our project turned out, and the learning process was well worth the effort/anguish.<br>
